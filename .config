[Capture]

; device URL
device: rtsp://192.168.42.10:554/user=admin&password=&channel=1&stream=0.sdp

; Media Backend: options are gst, cv2, or v4l2.
; 'gst':    (default - preferred) GStreamer Standalone. Bypass OpenCV, and
;           provides the highest timestamps accuracy.
; 'cv2':    OpenCV method. Reliable but has poor timestamping performance. 
; 'v4l2':   OpenCV with v4l2, uses v4l2 hardware acceleration with OpenCV.
; If gst, or v4l2 return an error, the code reverts to cv2.
media_backend: gst

uyvy_pixelformat: false

; The capture device resolution
width: 1920
height: 1080

; Frames per second (FPS) are precisely calculated and reported at the end of
; each capture session when in GStreamer standalone mode. This information can
; be found in each session's log by searching for 'Last Calculated FPS'. Please
; update the value here with the log's reported value. The calculate FPS
; often differs from the nominal FPS, usually by less than 0.1%.
; Example: fps: 24.98122
fps: 24.98122

; Camera Latency Settings for GStreamer Timestamps
; ------------------------------------------------
; The following two parameters correct for camera latency when in GStreamer
; Standalone mode. The settings are ignored when using other media_backend
; methods.
; The settings should be experimentally establishes for the specific setup.
; For example:  RPi4, IMX291, 720p @ 25 FPS, VBR
;               camera_buffer = 1
;               camera_latency = 0.05
; If timestamps are late, increase latency. If early, decrease latency.
; Formula is:
; corrected_timestamp = timestamp - camera_buffer / fps - total_latency
; camera_buffer corresponds to the number of frames in the camera's internal
; buffer. If these parameters are not present then RMS will use the default. 

; frames (integer). Default is 1
camera_buffer: 1

camera_latency: 0.05

; Log dropped frames. Only reliable for analog cameras

ff_format: fits

; Approximate Field-of-view in degrees
fov_w: 88.6
fov_h: 47.1

;                   -1 = rolling shutter

; 100-500 MB in size. Some stations have limited data or bad internet
; connections, so a reduced data set can be uploaded to the server.
; Options:
; 1 - Normal mode. Everything is uploaded, including FF files with detections.
; 2 - Skip FFs. Everything except two FF files will be uploaded. One with the
;     most matched stars and another random one with a meteor detection.
